# TuneTaster
This application uses the<a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/"> Spotify Web API </a>to retrieve tracks, albums and artists, which you can navigate through and listen to preview tracks based on what you search for.<br>

At the top of the app you will find a search bar and a picker. First, pick your desired result type being either artists, albums or tracks. After, query a desired result based on the result type you just selected.<br>

The Spotify API will then get called and populate results on screen. You can navigate your way through the results and select a desired track.
When a track is selected, a footer will be generated at the bottom of the screen, allowing for pausing and resuming of the selected track.
